# Use me as a submodule (optimal)
    git submodule add mpadulo@code.mainstorconcept.de:/git/mpseed

# Just fork me

__WARNING:__When using remotes they are meant mainly for branches of the same
project. So it maybe isn't the best idea

    git remote add mpseed mpadulo@code.mainstorconcept.de:/git/mpseed.git

    # OPTION 1:Avoid accidental pushings to remote, and pull direct to master
    git remote set-url --push mpseed no-pushing 

    # OPTION 2: Create a local tracking branch, and merge only local branches
    git fetch mpseed # Downloads the remote
    git checkout -b mpseed mpseed/master
